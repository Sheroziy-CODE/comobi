  <p align="center">
    Communication amongst car drivers has remained limited, anonymous and one-sided over the past 130 yearsðŸ™„ðŸ˜¤. We will build a working prototype that allows drivers to           communicate with each other on the road.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Problem

Flashing lights, rude hand gestures or honking the horn...ðŸ™„ðŸ˜¤ Communication amongst car drivers has remained limited, anonymous and one-sided over the past 130 years. Research has found that, when sitting in cars, drivers see other motorists as machines rather than social actors. Additionally our identity gets reduced down to the brand of the vehicle.

When you combine all of these factors, you have a really potent recipe for aggressive and anti-social driving behavior (Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Ratan & Tsai, 2014).â€¨

Solution

Thankfully, most car drivers want to communicate social cues and add nuance to their communication like "ope, sorry bud" or "get out of the fast lane please". Within the framework of a study, a car-driver admitted that instead of honking the horn and getting angry, he would have shown more tolerance if it had been possible to nuance his protest (Wang, 2019; Sung, 2019).
